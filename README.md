## Week 2 - Light and Perception

Western culture is a visual culture, there is no scape to that, probably because in the caves age primal human were able to communicate by painting walls before inventing any kind of dialect. That historic event presumably conditioned how our culture was built and how it was spread to all colonized territories. Stroke by stroke and color by color, during a span of approximately 30,000 years a representation of the world was slowly stablished as the way how reality looks –or how we should interpret it– until coming to the present to this "society of the spectacle" as Debord called it.

But, as Turrel raises, the representation of the world we see is not necessary how it looks like because what we see of light is just the colors that are reflected in the objects around us but not the light itself -so we can't catch light's essence. So have we been misled? or at least forced? Well, maybe, but what we know -and it was said by Plato around 2,500 years ago– in terms of perception is that we are in a cave sitting back to reality and the only we can see is the world's light reflected in the cave's wall. No more than that.

And this can be used to understand how western culture has told it's own history and how western technology has been part of the narrative. For example, how television became the most important media device when it was able to show just a small portion of the world. Or how press became the "real truth" and the authorized storyteller of the contemporary societies. Both, together and separately, have been the most important misinformation agents of the last 3 centuries, but society still see the world through their filter. Or nowadays, how internet and smartphones play a significant role in telling and deforming reality by the way we get informed by Google or Facebook, as well as creating new realities by gathering us with unknown people or by using AR applications.

Finally, perception is something we can't scape from. But something interesting to explore is: if perception is a biased understanding of the world, western perception is a biased understanding of a biased understanding of the world. So what happen with other perceptions? For example, what happened with Mapuche people's perception in southern Chile after Spanish came and imposed western catholicism? How that perception can talk with western perception? How perception of African tribes dispute the conceptual territory? I think I can't answer this question right now, but I hope I'll do during the semester.
